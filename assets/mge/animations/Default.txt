time is the time for the keyframe values
position is the position the object will have (relative to its parent)
rotation is how the object will be rotated (relative to its parent)
scale is how the object will be scaled (relative to its parent)

time values are written seconds : milliseconds, for example 1:05
fractions are also possible (1.5 instead of 1:30)

if you leave a field empty, it will have the same value as the last keyframe
